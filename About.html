        <h2>The History of The Redrock Inn</h2>
        <p>When we started this restaurant nobody thought we could get this far, but only through hard work and determination
          has our dream came true. This restaurant started out as an idea in our heads. I'm not quite sure who thought of the 
          idea to create a restaurant but we all saw it through. The Redrock Inn has a variety of food and the staff is always 
          willing to help. The owners of this restaurant are Caleb Uhouse, Daniel Cramer, and Seth Workman. Their contact info 
          is in the link to the side.
